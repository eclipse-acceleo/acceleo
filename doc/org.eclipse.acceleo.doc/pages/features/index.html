          Since Acceleo is based on the popular framework EMF, you can create your model with any kind of EMF based tool
          and use it as the input of your generation. You want to generate code from a model created with:

          In the beginning, you will want to write quickly an efficient generator but once you'll be done, you will need to
          deliver it to your customers and for that you will have to build it and to embed it inside an application.
          If you are aiming to use your generator within Eclipse, Acceleo can create an Eclipse based UI to integrate your
          generator in an Eclipse instance and it also let you build easily you generator to use it as an Eclipse plugins
          but some of your end-users may need to use your generator out of Eclipse. For those use cases, Acceleo also supports
          the compilation and the launch of an Acceleo generator out of Eclipse. If you can call Java source code, you can
          launch an Acceleo generator.

              When you want to start a code generation project with Acceleo, your first action is to create an Acceleo project.
              Inside of an Acceleo project, you can place Acceleo modules and the builder that comes with the Acceleo project will
              automatically compile the modules for you. The Acceleo project is also a container for several key preferences like
              the kind of serialization wanted for Acceleo modules or the severity of the error detection during the compilation.

        <h2>Acceleo Perspective</h2>
        <p>
          The Acceleo perspective defines the ideal workbench to work on an Acceleo generator. It contains at its center the Acceleo
          editor surrounded by several views dedicated to the edition of a code generator. You can find in the Acceleo perspective
          the following views:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The "Package Explorer" view</li>
          <li>The "Outline" view</li>
          <li>The "Interpreter" view</li>
          <li>The "Problems" view</li>

          <li>The "Result" view</li>
          <li>The "Overrides" view</li>
          <li>The "Generation Patterns" view</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Those view will let you test manipulate the files in your Acceleo project, test Acceleo expressions, have a look at the
          problems and errors found in your project, see the traceability of your generated code and use code generation design
          patterns.

          The Acceleo tooling features a code search system that let's you find out all the references to a selected
          template or query.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Acceleo Editor</h2>
        <p>
          The Acceleo editor is the center of the Acceleo tooling. It is associated with Acceleo modules (".mtl" files) and provides
          all the features of a modern programming editor to make you more productive when developing a code generator. As such, you
          can find in the Acceleo editor features like real time error detection, syntax highlighting, code completion,
          code navigation, a dynamic outline, etc.
        </p>

          <li class="span4">
            You can also change the colors used by the Acceleo editor in the Acceleo preference menu available in the Window -> Preferences
            -> Acceleo menu.
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Quick fixes</h2>
        <p>
          The Acceleo editor also features support for "quick fixes". Thanks to the "Ctrl+1" shortcut, you can have access to
          solutions to basic problems in a few seconds. Those quick fixes will let you for example define a new template or a new
          query to replace an unknown operation that you may be trying to call in your module.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Refactoring</h2>
        <p>
          The Acceleo tooling provides several refactoring tools to help you rename or move your modules, templates and
          queries within your project easily.

        <p>
          Acceleo lets you use Java source code to compute complexe operation that may be impossible to realize using the
          Acceleo language. As such, you can be sure that you will be able to generate even the most complex requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to use a Java service, you need to use the Acceleo operation "invoke" in order to tell Acceleo to call your Java
          method and give you the result. Java services are limited to parameters and return value with the a type from one of the
          meta-models used in the generator or a "primitive type" (String, Integer, Real, Boolean, etc..).

        </div>
        <p>
          In order to catch bugs, Acceleo contains a debugger that can be used easily to monitor a generation and stop at user defined
          breakpoints. This debugger can let you move instructions by instructions in the execution of your module and you can even have
          a look at the state of your variable.
        </p>
        <p>
          you can launch an Acceleo generator in debug by using the "Debug As..." menu to launch the generation instead of the "Run As..."
          menu. If you have launched the generation with the default "Acceleo Plug-in Application" launcher, the Acceleo modules will
          be debugged but if you use the advanced stand alone Java launcher, the Java code behind the curtain will be debugged.
        </p>
        <div class="alert alert-info">
          <strong>Tips and tricks:</strong> An Acceleo generation being a workspace modifying operation, you will not be able to modify
          the workspace during the generation. If you try to create a new file for example, the platform will make you wait after the
          completion of the generation to create the file.

        <p>
          Starting with Acceleo 3.2.0, you are now able to find the Interpreter view in the Acceleo tooling. Thanks to this view, you can use
          the Acceleo language to test and evaluate directly Acceleo expressions without having to build and run a whole code generator. This
          view is also extensible and as such, you can contribute your own evaluation language very easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interpreter is easily exitensible to let other person contribute their own language to use to manipulate EMF based elements.

          With static override, you can easily re-use the content of an existing module and change a piece of its original behavior.
          Dynamic override is on a whole different level as it let you change the behavior of an existing generator by defining templates
          that will replace existing templates of the generator. This way, like with aspect oriented programming, you can patch an existing
          generator built, certified and deployed on your customers computer without having to change the original generator.

          If you wish to integrate your Acceleo generator inside of Eclipse for your customers, so that they won't have to manipulate an Acceleo
          project, you can use a wizard provided by Acceleo to create a basic Eclipse user interface for your generator.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can create this user interface project with the following instructions. Right click on an Acceleo generator and select
          File -> New -> Project -> Acceleo Model to Text -> Acceleo UI Launcher -> Next -> Next -> Next. There you can select the name
          of your generator, the kind of file that should be used for the generation (*.uml for an UML generator) and where the code
          will be generated, by default, it will be generated in a folder named "src-gen" located at the root of the project containing the input model.

          Within Eclipse, an Acceleo project automatically builds your modules but you may want to have your Acceleo generators inside of
          a continuous integration system. In order to do that, Acceleo provides support for stand alone maven compilation that can be
          plugged easily inside any maven based build.
