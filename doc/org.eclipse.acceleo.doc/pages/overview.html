          This document provides an overview of the user-visible features of the Acceleo plug-ins
          which make it easy to develop and run Acceleo modules inside Eclipse. It assumes some
          familiarity with the language itself, although you do not need to be an expert to start
          using the plug-ins: using the provided example projects and the powerful completion feature
          of the Acceleo editor, it is very easy to get started once you understand the basic principles.

        <h2>Download</h2>
        <p>
          Acceleo can be downloaded and installed in a number of ways. If you have an existing Eclipse installation and simply
          with to install Acceleo in it, you can use the Eclipse Marketplace (starting with Eclipse 3.7 Indigo) or the official
          update site. If you want to start with a fresh new install of Eclipse, have a look at the Eclipse Modeling bundle provided
          by the Amalgamation project to start with a development environment dedicated to model driven development. Advanced users
          can also choose to install Acceleo directly using the zipped update site.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Eclipse Marketplace</h3>
        <p>
          In order to always have the latest release, you can use the Eclipse Marketplace provided in all standard Eclipse installation
          since Eclipse 3.7 Indigo.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Open the Eclipse Marketplace</li>
          <li>Search for Acceleo</li>

      <section id="standards">
        <div class="page-header">
          <h1>Standards <small>a love story.</small></h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          Acceleo has always been developed with the respect of standards in mind. Here you can have a look at the various standard
          on which Acceleo is built.
        </p>
        
        <h2>MOFM2T</h2>
        <p>
          The MOFM2T standard defines a code generation language named MTL (model to text transformation language). The language used
          in Acceleo is an implementation of this standard. You can find more about MOFM2T on the OMG's website.
        </p>
        
        <h2>EMF</h2>
        <p>
          Acceleo is based on the industrial standard EMF allowing us to generate code from countless of other tools. Thanks to this use
          of EMF, Acceleo can generate code from graphical models created with GMF or textual representation created with Xtext.
        </p>
        
        <h2>OCL</h2>
        <p>
          The Acceleo language is a superset of the OCL language and as such the Acceleo project is depending on the implementation of
          the OCL language realized in the Eclipse Foundation.
        </p>
        
        <h2>UML</h2>
        <p>
          Since Acceleo is based on top of EMF, you can use it in collaboration with UML based tools that are using the
          EMF based implementation of UML from the Eclipse Foundation.
        </p>

      <section id="contribution">

          <h1>Contribution <small>give back to the community.</small></h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          Acceleo is an open source software and as such, you can not only report and track problems very openly but you
          can also download its source code to fork it or to contribute to the project. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Reporting</h2>
        <p>
          If you want to report some problems that you have found in Acceleo, you should use the
          <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?classification=Modeling;product=M2T;component=Acceleo;bug_status=NEW;bug_status=ASSIGNED;bug_status=REOPENED;list_id=776826">Bugzilla</a>
          instance of the Eclipse Foundation. First, make sure that the issue has not been reported already. You can also ask a
          question about your problem first on the <a href="http://eclipse.org/forums/index.php/f/24/">Eclipse Newsgroups</a> or on
          <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/acceleo">Stack Overflow</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Answering</h2>
        <p>
          If you are mastering Acceleo, you can help newcomers by answering their question on the official
          <a href="http://eclipse.org/forums/index.php/f/24/">Eclipse Newsgroups</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <p>
          And if you want to contribute to an open source software, look no further, as you can contribute easily to Acceleo.
          Have a look at our <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Acceleo/Setup_Environment">contribution guide</a>, set up your
          development environment and in a few minutes you can be ready to code.
